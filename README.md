# SteamCMD GUI
SteamCMD GUI allows you to use [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) on Windows without a command line interface, nor batch files, using a very simple and intuitive graphical interface.

This specific repo is a rewrite of the [original](https://github.com/DioJoestar/SteamCMD-GUI), changing the language from Visual Basic to C# (WinForms). I intend to add more features, as well as improve on what was already there.
